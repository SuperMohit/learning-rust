# Rust Learning Path: Low-Level Semantics Focus


## Phase 1: Foundations (2-3 weeks)

**Core Language Basics**
- Variables, mutability, and shadowing
- Primitive types and their memory representations
- Functions, control flow, and pattern matching
- Modules and project structure with Cargo

**Start Here:**
- The Rust Book (chapters 1-6)
- Practice with small CLI programs

## Phase 2: Ownership & Memory Model (3-4 weeks)

**Deep Dive into Ownership**
- Stack vs heap allocation
- Move semantics and Copy trait
- Borrowing rules and the borrow checker
- Lifetimes and lifetime annotations
- Reference types and their costs

**Low-Level Focus:**
- Understanding `std::mem::size_of` and memory layout
- Drop trait and RAII patterns
- Interior mutability (`Cell`, `RefCell`)
- Zero-cost abstractions concept

**Resources:**
- Rust Book chapters 4, 10, 15
- "Visualizing Memory Layout of Rust's Data Types" blog posts
- Practice: Implement data structures from scratch (linked list, vector)

## Phase 3: Unsafe Rust & FFI (2-3 weeks)

**Understanding Unsafe**
- Raw pointers and pointer arithmetic
- Unsafe superpowers and guarantees
- Calling C code (FFI)
- Writing safe abstractions over unsafe code

**Projects:**
- Create FFI bindings to a C library
- Implement a custom allocator
- Build unsafe data structures (intrusive linked list)

**Resources:**
- Rust Book chapter 19
- The Rustonomicon (start reading)

## Phase 4: Advanced Memory & Concurrency (3-4 weeks)

**Memory Deep Dive**
- `std::mem` functions (`transmute`, `forget`, `ManuallyDrop`)
- Understanding `Pin` and `Unpin`
- Custom smart pointers
- Memory ordering and atomics

**Concurrency Model**
- Send and Sync traits
- Arc, Mutex, and atomic reference counting
- Lock-free data structures
- Thread safety guarantees

**Resources:**
- The Rustonomicon (complete)
- "Programming Rust" by Blandy & Orendorff (chapters on concurrency)

## Phase 5: Performance & Optimization (2-3 weeks)

**Low-Level Performance**
- Understanding LLVM IR generation
- Inline assembly
- SIMD operations
- Profiling and benchmarking
- Reading generated assembly (`cargo asm`)

**Projects:**
- Optimize hot paths in real code
- Write SIMD-accelerated algorithms
- Benchmark different approaches

## Phase 6: Systems Programming (Ongoing)

**Advanced Topics**
- Custom allocators and allocator APIs
- Async/await internals and Future trait
- Procedural macros
- Building OS components or embedded systems

**Project Ideas:**
- Write a memory allocator
- Build a simple kernel or bootloader
- Create embedded firmware (no_std)
- Implement a virtual machine or interpreter

## Essential Resources

**Books:**
- *The Rust Programming Language* (The Book)
- *The Rustonomicon* (unsafe Rust)
- *Rust for Rustaceans* by Jon Gjengset
- *Programming Rust* by Blandy & Orendorff

**Online:**
- Rust compiler development guide
- Jon Gjengset's YouTube channel (Crust of Rust series)
- Fasterthanlime's blog posts
- "Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists"

**Practice:**
- Implement standard library components from scratch
- Contribute to systems-level crates
- Read source code: tokio, servo, ripgrep

## Weekly Practice Routine

1. **Read** theory (1-2 hours)
2. **Code** exercises (2-3 hours)
3. **Analyze** assembly output of your code (30 min)
4. **Deep dive** into one standard library type's implementation (1 hour)
5. **Experiment** with unsafe code in controlled environment (1 hour)

## Key Mindsets

- Always ask: "What's happening in memory?"
- Read compiler error messages carefullyâ€”they teach ownership
- Use tools: `cargo expand`, `cargo asm`, `cargo miri`
- Don't fear unsafe, but respect it
- Understand the "zero-cost abstraction" principle
